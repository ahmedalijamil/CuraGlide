# 🏥 CuraGlide

**Your well-being in every step — accessed from a single touch.**

CuraGlide is a comprehensive health-information and learning platform designed to help users understand their health concerns, find nearby hospitals, and explore clinical-style cases for educational purposes. Built with **Streamlit** and powered by **Groq** AI models.

## ✨ Features

- **👤 Patient Mode:** Input basic health metrics, symptoms, and medical history. The AI acts as a cautious health-information assistant to provide an analysis of your urgency, potential conditions, and actionable advice (What to do now, What to monitor). 
- **🏥 Hospital Finder:** Enter a location (city or area) to discover nearby hospitals using the OpenStreetMap API. Get the distance to the hospital and quick access to Google Maps for navigation.
- **🧪 Case Lab:** Generate clinical-style educational cases (e.g., diagnostic mysteries, emergency presentations) based on specified topics and difficulties. Practice reasoning through symptoms, explanations, warning signs, and more.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** (Backend logic)
- **Streamlit** (Interactive Web UI)
- **Groq API** (LLM inference for Patient Mode and Case Lab)
- **Requests & OpenStreetMap Nominatim API** (Hospital geolocation and search)
